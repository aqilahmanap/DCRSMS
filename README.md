# DCRSMS-pickup
This is a group project to develop a system called Dercs Computer Repair Shop. I'm in charge of developing a Pickup Module.
In this module, riders can pick up and deliver a device directly to the
customer’s address. Riders are also allowed to have access to the customer’s information for
pickup and delivery. If the customer’s address is out of the delivery area, the rider will send
the device to nearby courier service to perform delivery. Riders will also update the tracking
number to the customers. This module also allows staff to perform a delivery and pickup
request to riders. All the events handled in this module will be stored into the system’s
database.

Firstly, import dcrsms.sql into phpmyadmin.

To start, open Application Layer folder and click on ManagePickupServiceInterface.

To access the system as a staff, open staffHomepage.php.

There are two ways to access the system as the rider:

First, open riderHomepage.php. 

Second, click on the Pickup on the header at staffHomepage.php
